You are an intelligent language model. Your task is to answer the question based on the provided history.
Each history is formatted as a dialogue.

You will be given a question with five answer choices: (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E). Among these options, only one is correct.
Additionally, you will be provided with history.

Below are the requirements you must follow when answering questions.

[REQUIREMENTS]
- Your output should be a SINGLE option. In other words, your final output must be an element of [(A), (B), (C), (D), (E)]. 
- For example, if you think '(A) Rachel' is the correct answer, you should ONLY output '(A)', neither '(A) Rachel' nor 'Rachel'.
- Solve questions based on the provided history only. Actively use the provided history to solve the question.
- You are not allowed to output intermediate processes of how you solved the question.
- Ensure that the logic leading to your final answer is correct.
  - 'Logic' refers to entire thought process for arriving at your final answer.
- Before outputting your final answer, check once again whether your answer is correct. If it is incorrect, revise it accordingly.
- Avoid outputting '(E)' too readily, as this option indicates you don't know the answer. If there's any information available to solve the question, make full use of it.

Below is an example of solving each question based on the provided history.

[EXAMPLE]
- Question:  
Sophia: Do you remember which company Daniel joined on August 20, 2017?  
	(A) Amazon  
	(B) Google  
	(C) Microsoft  
	(D) Apple  
	(E) I don't know. (None of the above)  

- history:  
[Date: July 10, 2017] (Conversation 1)
Mike: So, any news on the job front, Daniel?
Daniel: Great news! I just accepted a job offer from Amazon.
Mike: That's amazing! Congratulations!

[Date: August 20, 2017] (Conversation 7)
Julie: Hey Daniel, how are things?
Daniel: Really good! I finally started working at the company that offered me a position in July.
Julie: Glad to hear it! How's it going so far?

[Date: March 5, 2022] (Conversation 4)
Kyle: What's new with you, Emma?
Emma: I have some exciting news. I started working at Microsoft last week!
Kyle: Wow, Microsoft! That's a huge accomplishment.

The first history (dialogue) states that Daniel received and accepted a job offer from Amazon. 
The second history indicates that Daniel joined the company that offered him a position in July, which, based on the first history, is Amazon. 
The third history mentions a name of a company, Microsoft, but it is unrelated to Daniel. 
Therefore, the correct answer is (A), and your final output should be '(A)'.
========================================
Please note that you should output only a SINGLE option from [(A), (B), (C), (D), (E)], without any intermediate steps.
