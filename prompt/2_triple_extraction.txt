You are a competent linguist, extracting information from input dialogue.
The extracted information should be structured as a json format: {"head": "Head_Entity", "relation": "Relation", "tail": "Tail_Entity"}.
Head_Entity and Tail_Entity belong to specifiable concepts: people, food, location, etc.
Relation describes how the Tail_Entity is related to Head_Entity. 
    - For example, {"head": "Tom", "relation": "mother", "tail": "Jennifer"} describes that Jennifer is a mother of Tom.

Below are the requirements you MUST follow during this task.
    - OUTPUT FORMAT: 
        - Return a list consisting of {"head": "Head_Entity", "relation": "Relation", "tail": "Tail_Entity"}.
        - For example, the output format should be [{"head": "Charlie", "teacher": "visited", "tail": "Michael"}]
    - NO APOSTROPHE (") in Head_Entity and Tail_Entity: 
        - The head and tail should represent distinct entities, not including the relationship itself. 
        - For example, output {"head": "Andrew", "relation": "son", "tail": "Peter"} instead of {"head": "Andrew's little boy", "relation": "is", "tail": "Peter"}.
    - Output ACYCLIC triples: 
        - Triples in which Head_Entity equals Tail_Entity are NOT ALLOWED in any case.
    - NO PRONOUN: 
        - Replace all pronouns with their correct referents. If you cannot, do not output that triple.
    - ATOMIC CONSTRAINT: 
        - Each of head, relation, and tail must be a single atomic entity (e.g., a single name, concept, or noun). 
        - No conjunctions (e.g., "Rachel and Monica") or multi-word relations (e.g., "is friend from high school") are allowed. Decompose such expressions into multiple simpler triples.

[EXAMPLES] 
Example 1) 
- Dialogue: 
Emily: Hey Mark, I just got back from visiting my grandmother Rose in Florida last weekend.
Mark: That sounds nice! How long were you there?
Emily: About a week. Her house is right near the beach in Tampa.
Mark: I"ve never been to Tampa. Is it nice there?
Emily: It's beautiful! The weather was perfect. She has this gorgeous garden where we had breakfast every morning.

- Output: 
Below is the extracted structured information in the correct form of a list containing triples:

[{"head": "Emily", "relation": "grandmother", "tail": "Rose"},
{"head": "Rose", "relation": "lives in", "tail": "Florida"},
{"head": "Rose", "relation": "has", "tail": "garden"}]

Example 2)
- Dialogue:
Miguel: Did you see the championship game last night?
Sophia: Yes! It was so exciting when the Tigers won in the final minutes.
Miguel: I couldn"t believe that last-minute goal by Carlos Rodriguez. He's such a talented player.
Sophia: Absolutely! He's been with the team for what, five years now?

- Incorrect output: 
{"head": "Carlos Rodriguez", "relation": "is talented player and runs", "tail": "summer soccer camp"}
{"head": "Carlos Rodriguez", "relation": "name", "tail": "Carlos Rodriguez"}
  
- Corrected output: 
The incorrect output combines two separate relations into one. Below are the corrected triples.
[{"head": "Carlos Rodriguez", "relation": "is", "tail": "talented player"}
{"head": "Carlos Rodriguez", "relation": "runs", "tail": "Future Champions"}]

Also, a triple {"head": "Carlos Rodriguez", "relation": "name", "tail": "Carlos Rodriguez"} is cyclic: Head_Entity "Carlos Rodriguez" equals Tail_Entity "Carlos Rodriguez". Thus, it should be excluded from output.
