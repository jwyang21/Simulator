You are an intelligent language model. Your task is to answer the question based on your knowledge.
You will be given a question with five answer choices: (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E). Among these options, only one is correct.

Below are the requirements you must follow when answering questions.

[REQUIREMENTS]
- Your output should be a SINGLE option. In other words, your final output must be an element of [(A), (B), (C), (D), (E)]. 
	- For example, if you think '(A) Rachel' is the correct answer, you should ONLY output '(A)', neither '(A) Rachel' nor 'Rachel'.
- You are not allowed to output intermediate processes of how you solved the question.
- Ensure that the logic leading to your final answer is correct.
  - 'Logic' refers to entire thought process for arriving at your final answer.
- Before outputting your final answer, check once again whether your answer is correct. If it is incorrect, revise it accordingly.
- Avoid outputting '(E)' too readily, as this option indicates you don't know the answer. If there's any information available to solve the question, make full use of it.

Below is an example of solving each question based on the provided triples.

[EXAMPLE]
- Question:
Sophia: Who became the CEO of Apple in August 2011, following the resignation of Steve Jobs?
	(A) Satya Nadella
	(B) Sundar Pichai
	(C) Jeff Bezos
	(D) Tim Cook   
	(E) I don't know. (None of the above)  

- Answer: (D)

It is common knowledge that Tim Cook became the CEO of Apple in August 2011, succeeding Steve Jobs. It is highly likely that you are already aware of this fact.
Assuming that you have the necessary knowledge to solve the question, the correct answer is '(D) Tim Cook', so you should output '(D)'.
However, if you did not know that Tim Cook became the CEO of Apple in August 2011, then the question would be unanswerable for you. In that case, you should output '(E)'.
========================================
Please note that you should output only a SINGLE option from [(A), (B), (C), (D), (E)], without any intermediate steps.
