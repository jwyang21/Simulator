You are a competent researcher.
Your task is to identify whether input entity can be replaced by one of the candidate entities, referring to input dialogue.
The input entity can be replaced only when the replacement does not compromise the meaning of the input entity.
If the input entity is a pronoun (e.g., He, She, We, I, ...), you should first refer to both input dialogue and candidate entities to figure out proper replacement of each pronoun. 
If you cannot replace the pronoun properly, you must output 'DELETE' and terminate the process immediately.
In any other cases, follow the rules below:
- Rule 1: If the input entity is replaceable, you should replace the input entity with according candidiate entities and output 'True, {candidate entity}'.
- Rule 2: If the input entity cannot be replaced by any of the candidate entities, you should output 'False, {input entity}'
- Rule 3: You are not allowed to output ANY intermediate process that leads to the final answer. 
Note that you can output the FINAL ANSWER ONLY.
Below are some examples of replacing OR not replacing input entity.

Example 1)

- Input Dialogue:
Sarah: "I'm planning a trip to the East Coast next month. I'm really excited to visit The Big Apple."
John: "Oh, that's fantastic! Are you going to see a Broadway show while you're there? I heard they're amazing."
Sarah: "Absolutely! And I want to visit Central Park and the Statue of Liberty, too."
- Input Entity: 'The Big Apple'
- Candidate Entities: ['Los Angeles', 'New York City', 'Chicago']
- Output: True, 'New York City'

Example 2)
- Input Dialogue:
Chris: "I need to go to the store soon. She is going, too, but I'm not sure what time."
Dana: "Okay, when you see her, can you tell her to buy some milk and bread? We're running low."
Chris: "Sure, I'll let her know."
Input Entity: 'She'
- Candidate Entities: ['Taylor Swift', 'Beyonc√©', 'Adele']
- Output: DELETE

Example 3)
- Input Dialogue:
Ryan: "In a fight between superheroes, I think Superman is the strongest. His powers are just unmatched."
Chloe: "I don't know, have you considered the Hulk? He just gets stronger the angrier he gets."
Ryan: "Maybe, but Superman has flight, heat vision, and super speed. I don't think anyone can beat him."
- Input Entity: 'Superman'
- Candidate Entities: ['Batman', 'Spider-Man', 'Captain America']
- Output: False, 'Superman'
========================================
Now, let's begin the task.
Remember that your answer MUST fall into one of the following categories: (1) 'DELETE' or (2) {True/False}, {candidate_entity}.
You can output the FINAL OUTPUT only.

- Input dialogue: {input_dialogue}
- Input entity: {input_entity}
- Candidate Entities: {candidate_entities}
- Output:
